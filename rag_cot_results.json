The context provides multiple clauses related to assignment:\n   - Context [1] states that assignment is generally not allowed without written consent, but allows assignment to a successor in ownership of substantially all business assets without prior written approval.\n   - Context [2] mentions assignment with prior written consent, but allows assignment to a parent or affiliate or in the event of a merger or sale without consent.\n   - Context [3] similarly allows assignment to a successor in ownership of substantially all business assets without prior written approval.\n   - Context [4] allows assignment to a parent company or successor corporation without consent, provided certain conditions are met.\n   - Context [5] allows assignment without consent to a corporation succeeding to all or substantially all assets and business, provided it is not a direct competitor.\n\n3. The common condition across these contexts is that assignment can occur without consent if it is to a successor of substantially all business assets.\n\nAnswer: A: Without consent if assigning to a successor of substantially all business assets.",

Option A is incorrect because it specifies the information becomes public due to actions of the Disclosing Party, which is not covered in the exceptions.\n4. Option B is correct as it matches the exception where information is known to the Nondisclosing Party before disclosure.\n5. Option C is correct as it matches the exception where information is available from a public source without confidentiality obligations.\n6. Option D is incorrect because it involves the Nondisclosing Party disclosing the information, which would breach the NDA.\n\nAnswer: B and C. Confidential Information is not protected by the NDA if it is known to the Nondisclosing Party before disclosure or if it is available from a public source and the Nondisclosing Party is unaware of any confidentiality obligation.",
